# UKF-M - Python Implementation

## Download

You can download the source code at
https://github.com/CAOR-MINES-ParisTech/ukfm.

## Installation

The Python package has been tested under Python 3.5 on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine.
To install:

1. Download the repo

```
    git clone https://github.com/CAOR-MINES-ParisTech/ukfm.git
```

2. Install package requirement (numpy, matplotlib, etc)

```
    cd ukfm
    cd python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Keep into the Python folder and run

```
    pip install . -vvv
```

or

```
    pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag tells pip to install the package in-place, which lets you make
changes to the code without having to reinstall every time.
